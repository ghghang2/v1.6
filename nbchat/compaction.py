"""Compaction Engine
===================

Keeps the token count sent to the model under a configured threshold by
summarising the oldest portion of the conversation.

Key design decisions
--------------------
* History is never mutated with a ``compacted`` row.  Instead, the summary
  lives in ``context_summary`` on the engine and is injected into the system
  prompt by ``chat_builder.build_messages``.  This keeps the stored history
  append-only and makes the split logic much simpler.

* Splitting is turn-aware.  History is first grouped into logical *turns*
  (each starting with a ``user`` row).  Compaction drops whole turns from the
  front, so we never accidentally split an ``assistant_full`` / ``tool`` /
  ``analysis`` triplet.

* For pathological cases where a single turn exceeds the threshold on its own
  (very long agentic loops), ``_find_safe_split`` scans forward within the
  turn for the first row whose role cannot be a structural *dependent* of the
  row before it.  This is a last resort — whole-turn dropping is always
  preferred.

* Successive compactions are cumulative: the previous ``context_summary`` is
  fed to the summariser so the new summary folds it in without an extra API
  call.
